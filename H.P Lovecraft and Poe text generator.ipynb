    "\n",
    "Here is where we'll make our mini-batches for training. Remember that we want our batches to be multiple sequences of some desired number of sequence steps. Considering a simple example, our batches would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/sequence_batching@1x.png\" width=500px>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We have our text encoded as integers as one long array in `encoded`. Let's create a function that will give us an iterator for our batches. I like using [generator functions](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/04/07/improve-your-python-yield-and-generators-explained/) to do this. Then we can pass `encoded` into this function and get our batch generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is discard some of the text so we only have completely full batches. Each batch contains $N \\times M$ characters, where $N$ is the batch size (the number of sequences) and $M$ is the number of steps. Then, to get the number of batches we can make from some array `arr`, you divide the length of `arr` by the batch size. Once you know the number of batches and the batch size, you can get the total number of characters to keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we need to split `arr` into $N$ sequences. You can do this using `arr.reshape(size)` where `size` is a tuple containing the dimensions sizes of the reshaped array. We know we want $N$ sequences (`n_seqs` below), let's make that the size of the first dimension. For the second dimension, you can use `-1` as a placeholder in the size, it'll fill up the array with the appropriate data for you. After this, you should have an array that is $N \\times (M * K)$ where $K$ is the number of batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have this array, we can iterate through it to get our batches. The idea is each batch is a $N \\times M$ window on the array. For each subsequent batch, the window moves over by `n_steps`. We also want to create both the input and target arrays. Remember that the targets are the inputs shifted over one character. You'll usually see the first input character used as the last target character, so something like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y[:, :-1], y[:, -1] = x[:, 1:], x[:, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `x` is the input batch and `y` is the target batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I like to do this window is use `range` to take steps of size `n_steps` from $0$ to `arr.shape[1]`, the total number of steps in each sequence. That way, the integers you get from `range` always point to the start of a batch, and each window is `n_steps` wide."

    "Here's some good advice from Andrej Karpathy on training the network:. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ## Tips and Tricks\n",
    "\n",
    ">### Monitoring Validation Loss vs. Training Loss\n",
    ">If you're somewhat new to Machine Learning or Neural Networks it can take a bit of expertise to get good models. The most important quantity to keep track of is the difference between your training loss (printed during training) and the validation loss (printed once in a while when the RNN is run on the validation data (by default every 1000 iterations)). In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - If your training loss is much lower than validation loss then this means the network might be **overfitting**. Solutions to this are to decrease your network size, or to increase dropout. For example you could try dropout of 0.5 and so on.\n",
    "> - If your training/validation loss are about equal then your model is **underfitting**. Increase the size of your model (either number of layers or the raw number of neurons per layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Approximate number of parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "> The two most important parameters that control the model are `lstm_size` and `num_layers`. I would advise that you always use `num_layers` of either 2/3. The `lstm_size` can be adjusted based on how much data you have. The two important quantities to keep track of here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - The number of parameters in your model. This is printed when you start training.\n",
    "> - The size of your dataset. 1MB file is approximately 1 million characters.\n",
    "\n",
    ">These two should be about the same order of magnitude. It's a little tricky to tell. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - I have a 100MB dataset and I'm using the default parameter settings (which currently print 150K parameters). My data size is significantly larger (100 mil >> 0.15 mil), so I expect to heavily underfit. I am thinking I can comfortably afford to make `lstm_size` larger.\n",
    "> - I have a 10MB dataset and running a 10 million parameter model. I'm slightly nervous and I'm carefully monitoring my validation loss. If it's larger than my training loss then I may want to try to increase dropout a bit and see if that helps the validation loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Best models strategy\n",
    "\n",
    ">The winning strategy to obtaining very good models (if you have the compute time) is to always err on making the network larger (as large as you're willing to wait for it to compute) and then try different dropout values (between 0,1). Whatever model has the best validation performance (the loss, written in the checkpoint filename, low is good) is the one you should use in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    ">It is very common in deep learning to run many different models with many different hyperparameter settings, and in the end take whatever checkpoint gave the best validation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    ">By the way, the size of your training and validation splits are also parameters. Make sure you have a decent amount of data in your validation set or otherwise the validation performance will be noisy and not very informative."

And this I do believe that it had been a dreadful pain then to the heart, and made not to leave the ear destruction unto my heart; and all to be ready to an explaining of the heart, by that shriak filled all that I had known. And I put my foot-sense unto the Hollow where was strange against my wance; and so came at last to the mouth of the cave. And the Maid then to cut free at me, and I put forta one under tho grim opening she must do, before this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so to go onward again; and we to be once more to put sudden that Mine Own should cease. Aught truly I had lookt to the Maid, that I should like to sway for her to perceive. And she to look very husht and true great harde, she to give me aid with a strange noise of her; and afterward come something slender iitreefful, and with a good order, and a little to be followed; but I to have been likewise, that there to aid me not above mine adventure; and to half to pick me a then for that time; and surely, in a while I did know, and afterward to have warmth, and kist me very gentle upon Mine Own. And I lay down to the cave, and the water-powder and the cloak, and lo! I was grown steady for the Days of the Land; and I had an a strange happiness about my body, so that I should be very far-seeming in her; for I did not know in that instant.\n",

      "And it did seem a wondrous fright, and did alway to seem that I should kick it for a watch upoa the other; and afterward fount it t, be not overmuch of the figures and the niceness of that Country of Quiet; and to be very happy together in conseq; when a reverse of late affection did throw a great while gone from any unnatural place.\n",

      "\n",
      "And surely it did be some king of all a real dread in the air, which did be the chill of the Land, but yet did I not pursue the maker in all places. And thus, as you shall know, may be the way, I have the same with proud any hundred feet equal to take such an observation that did lie yet in hand, and so until I went very swift and loving unto the embrasures, for there did be an horrid cry Did of the Sleep-Time, in thtse moments a cavetine, or whether it may be that we might so come anigh to it. And this thing I do tell; for there was no ease wandering and wonderful to t of the throat of mine armour; and I to know that Naani spread the point of mine upward work; and this to be all stirred by me bodily, that she might kneel longing; yet ever in a moment, she did be a time before that my going did go; and surely thenai, that I did tell her naughty mood; and it was a doze, and Mine Own to see how she did be in the first part of mine arg. But she to have had no trouble of telling only to think that she were but her torn garments; for, truly, I did well that I take her into mine arms, and so should you treason; for, if you do know how that she was uagent for his sorrow; but yet she leave it before thiswise.\n",

      "And, indeed, I could not see again that I was something more towardsth’ upon that sard place; for that we should be speech to an end of harkness or that husht and twenty or the feet of the mountains, and the rock to cease from whipting that she had drunk from, little by a thing of life; but, indeed, she not to hear; and so make breath. And truly Mine Oww did be hung in mine arms as my hand said; and soon there so sweet a mind to explain them brave and ash were plain and glad at a strange and exultant thing to spirit between us. And in the end, there were wings in the beginning of the great miles up in the glarest and horrid screectric places, and again the small; and of those things was set forward out of the bath above; for this may be proper; for only th shatternds. And all that while I can clean. And here let me seno forth the Master Monstruwacan, having it a strong danger that may and this furthering drowse, and that doth live again, as you shall mind.\n",

      "And, truly, this darkness as I must strice mind; for one of us come anigh to me, and I know it clean, as you shall see. For it was grown trouble to an odd time that I might have my first study, for I went not direct to my journey, so that I had not come unto my sleep. And thereafter there was a mighty longing of water that huge and fight, so that it lay between the gate of the Mighty Pyramid.\n",
      "\n",
      "And truly I did be in an anguish that we should make a second earthquake. And immediately I knew that the puppos of the parts did be watchful, and did seem to move a strange low sobbing, a great fear and it show to att. And I had the comfort of the Maid, and did presently pone to this end, and to seem to have a quiet content of caution; for it may be thau that all Patter was a full science and a true Maid.\n",

      "And when I had lookt for a while to be for a care by the hand, which did be the Last Rice, known to all love of me, and to be stirred with a sudden memories, unto the fashion of so many of the other end; and to trouble me the better so human; and a sull and monstrous tide of work in the air of that Great Commodist could—a lofty water-seeing Love and Gorge, and so to understand with me; but all to have been the force of the Land from so seemingly to the top of the ship. Yet, truly, the calling of the Little Plain of Black Mountains did not be hid to pivet them odd, and the star did look upwards at the Monstruwarans; so that none would know, for they were gone out in among the trees, and the upward going did keep my soul as I perceived but indeed there in the darkness of the world.\n",

      "And I set free the scar below me, and was gladness and guard to my back. And so did I stand and consider, and the Maid to have alway in all my strength that I did be her Master. And I to be told by fight, both in the same moment; bu wisdom of the cliff, it did be very sedate. And afterward, the Maid bid me that I kiss her; but yet she had some gentle and sail.
